I am an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at Fudan University, where I lead the System Security & Reliability ([SSR](https://gitee.com/fudan-csr)) research group. Prior to joining Fudan in 2021, I earned my PhD from Texas A&M University and subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at Georgia Tech. 

Our research at SSR is dedicated to constructing and advancing secure and reliable computing systems by addressing foundational challenges in the design, implementation, and verification of modern hardware-software co-designed computation. Key areas include:

- High-Performance Safe Programming
   - Memory-safe programming language
   - Language-level abstractions for hardware interaction
- Reliable Computing Systems
   - End-to-end AI system stacks
   - System-level optimization and acceleration
- Security Vetting and Assurance
   - Formal methods for code analysis
   - Integration of static analysis with AI-driven techniques
   - Vulnerability detection against real-world large-scale systems
